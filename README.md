# hello-world
Testing GitHub to see if it has any info that I need
about displaying (and/or possibly recording) a video on a Web site.
I have been trying for months to just take a video that a site user
has uploaded to my web site that I stored on AWS S3 and retrieve it
from S3 so that I can show the video in a small window on my site.
I have a file name originally that the user gives me that I give to 
S3 but when I get it back from S3, it gives me a buffer of data.  I
think that I can tell it to put it somewhere other than a buffer but
I am not sure whether this is a file name on the users device or a
URL.  Most video players that I have encountered require a URL if you
specify the video file programmatically (I am using Javascript) or 
that you know the file name at the time you are writing the code (which
is illogical for a Web site accepting a video from a site user).  I 
just need a simple call where I say here is a video file, play it.

This change is just to update the readme file.
